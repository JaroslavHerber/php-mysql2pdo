php-mysql2pdo
==========

### About:
mysql_* functions are removed from PHP7+.

Nevertheless, this script allows usage of often used mysql_*-functions in PHP7+.
It provides all needed functions, which use the PDO-object.

#### Usage:
Just include this file at the beginning of your php-file, which uses the old mysql_*-functions. Example:
    - require_once '/www/php5-compatibility/mysql2pdo.php';

Feel free to contribute to this project and pull missing function, you would like to use.
